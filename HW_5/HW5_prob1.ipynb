Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture\\nCommittee, said in a statement, ``Today's crop report confirms our\\nfears about the impacts of this summer's tragic drought.\\nFortunately, it appears we will have enough stocks to make it\\nthrough this marketing year.''\\n   The USDA's grim news came hours after President Reagan on\\nThursday signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at\\nhelping drought-stricken farmers recover.\\n   ``This bill isn't as good as rain,'' Reagan said to the nation's\\nfarmers. ``But it will tide you over until normal weather and your\\nown skills permit you to return to your accustomed role.''\\n   The new USDA crop estimates were based on field surveys as of\\nAug. 1. In May and June, before drought had made its biggest\\nimpact, USDA projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and an\\nassumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels.\\n   But those projections were revised downward a month ago to 5.2\\nbillion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder\\nof the season.\\n   The soybean harvest was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down\\n23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year. Prospects\\nlast spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July\\nprojection was 1.65 billion bushels.\\n   Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels,\\ndown 13 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987. In May and June,\\nthe USDA forecast this year's output would be up slightly. The July\\nprojection was 1.84 billion bushels\\n   The wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall, which\\nbarely stayed ahead of the drought. Later plantings of durum and\\nother spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness.\\n   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels,\\ndown 1 percent from last year. But durum and the other spring\\nvarieties, which are produced in the hard-hit northern plains,\\nshowed sharp declines.\\n   Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percent\\nfrom last year's harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212\\nmillion bushels, down 53 percent from 1987.\\n   Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1\\npercent from last year. The crop was projected at 13.7 billion\\nbales in July.\\n   Department officials said U.S. grain production this year is\\nexpected to total 192 million metric tons, 31 percent smaller than\\nthe 1987 output. The total grain supply for 1988-89 _ which\\nincludes inventories on hand at the beginning of the season _ is\\ndown 24 percent from last season.\\n   In addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields, Wilson\\nsaid production of some other spring-planted crops has suffered,\\nincluding: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288\\nmillion bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million\\nbushels, down 24 percent.\\n   Wilson said USDA experts ``continue to believe that the drought\\nwill add only one percentage point'' to consumer food prices this\\nyear.\\n   The department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3\\npercent to 5 percent. Before the heat and dry weather, USDA had\\nexpected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.\\n   Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer\\nprice index for food next year.\\n   ``That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food\\nprices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,'' Wilson said. ``So\\nthis would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.''\\n   He also said the United States is ``looking at an export\\nsituation that is not as good as it was a year ago.'' He said\\nproduction abroad would have to take up the slack in world food\\nsupply caused by the drought.\\n   ``Our figures here today would indicate that food production in\\nother countries has not been cut that much,'' he said. There\\nremained a possibility that the United States would import some\\nsoybeans this year, Wilson said.\\n   He scoffed at any suggestion, however, that the United States\\nmay have lost its capacity to produce sizeable crop surpluses. He\\nnoted that 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production\\nthis year in addition to millions of additional acres in the\\nlong-term Conservation Reserve Program.\\n   Meanwhile, USDA weatherman Norton Strommen said rain in the\\nmidcontinent in recent days has not meant an end to the drought.\\n   ``The drought, as you can see, is still basically with us\\nthroughout the entire United States,'' Strommen said.\\n\\x1a\"},\n",
